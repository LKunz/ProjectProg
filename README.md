# Project Programming

The goal of this project is to implement some encryption and decryption algorithms by means of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Content
* Caesar cipher (Caesar.py)
* A monoalphabetic substitution cipher (Substitution.py)
* A polyalphabetic substitution cipher (Symmetric.py)
* The RSA algorithm (RSA.py)
* Some implementation examples (implementation_examples.py)
* A user-friendly interface for testing (interface.py)

### Requirements
In order to run the interface you will need some libraries. See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for the list and how to install them.

### How to run the interface?
```
git clone https://github.com/LKunz/ProjectProg.git
cd ProjectProg
python interface.py
```

### Code Examples
See [implementation_examples.py](implementation_examples.py) for examples on the algorithms.

Ici mettre des examples de comment marche l'interface.

### Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
