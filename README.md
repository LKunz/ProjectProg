# Project Programming

The goal of this project is to implement some encryption and decryption algorithms by means of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Content
* Caesar cipher (Caesar.py)
* A monoalphabetic substitution cipher (Substitution.py)
* A polyalphabetic substitution cipher (Symmetric.py)
* The RSA algorithm (RSA.py)
* A user-friendly interface for testing (main.py)

### Requirements

In order to run the interface you will need the kivy library. Click [here](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation.html) for more information on how to install kivy.

### How to run the interface?
```
git clone https://github.com/LKunz/ProjectProg.git
cd ProjectProg
python main.py
```
Note that we only tried on Linux.

### Code Examples
See [implementation_examples.py](implementation_examples.py) for examples on the algorithms.
